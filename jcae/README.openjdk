Building OpenJDK
----------------

Here are instruction to build OpenJDK 7 for glibc 2.3. Note that this configuration is not supported upstream.

* Setup a Debian Etch chroot with debootstrap.

* Build and install gcc 4.6 from the upstream tarball.

* apt-get install unzip zip libasound2-dev libcupsys2-dev libxtst-dev libxi-dev

* Install Ant and Java 6 binary distribution

* hg clone http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7u/jdk7u

* Read README-build.html

* About README-builds.html#drops, the URL of archives to download can be found in jdk7u/jaxws/jaxws.properties.

* The freetype package of Debian Etch is too old so build a new one from upstream sources. Then set
    ALT_FREETYPE_HEADERS_PATH=/usr/local/include/freetype2
    ALT_FREETYPE_LIB_PATH=/usr/local/lib/

* Revert this patch as glibc 2.3 doesn't have inotify:
    http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7/l10n/jdk/raw-diff/a0dde3ff1dfd/src/solaris/native/sun/nio/fs/LinuxWatchService.c

* If when building javax.management CORBA packages cannot be find try:
   cd build/linux-amd64/classes/
   cp -a ../corba/classes/* .

* Delete all *.debuginfo from the j2re-image directory to make it lighter to deploy

* cp /lib/libbz2.so.1.0 to jdk7u/build/linux-amd64/j2re-image/lib/amd64 as the target OS may not have it
